Developed a real-time face detection application using OpenCV. Implemented a Haar Cascade classifier to accurately detect and highlight faces in live video streams captured from a webcam. Optimized the system for performance and accuracy, ensuring smooth frame rates and reliable face detection under various lighting conditions. Successfully handled multiple face detections simultaneously and addressed key challenges such as camera access, detection accuracy, and resource management.
